# PCIe

Linux starting point: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/602fb860945fd6dce7989fcd3727d5fe4282f785/drivers/pci/controller/pcie-brcmstb.c#L865



pcie regs = Address 0xfd500000 (size 0x9310)

matches: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/b23024676a2f135dbde2221481e2f4af616d0445/arch/arm/boot/dts/bcm2711.dtsi#L555-L587

in low peripheral mode, main peripherals are at 0x00000000fc000000
suggesting low peripherals + 0x01500000

=> 0x47c000000 + 0x01500000 = 0x47d500000 (for full 35-bit address map)


Steps from enumeration example above:
* set bits 0 and 1 of 32 bit register [0xfd509210] (reset controller)
* sleep for 1 millisecond
* clear bit 1 of 32 bit register [0xfd509210]
* read back value
* read 32 bit register [0xfd50406c] (REVISION)
* write 0xffffffff to 32 bit register [0xfd504314] (clear interrupts)
* write 0xffffffff to 32 bit register [0xfd504310] (mask interrupts)
* clear bit 0 of 32 bit register [0xfd509210] (bring controller out of reset)
* read 32 bit status register [0xfd504068] every 1ms, up to 100ms, until bits 4 and 5 are set
* report link not ready failure, if bits 4 and 5 are not set, and log value of register
* report PCIe not in RC mode, if bit 7 is not set, and log value of register
* log PCIe link is ready




Steps from linux kernel:
* set bit 1 of register [0xfd509210]
* sleep for 100-200 microseconds
* clear bit 1 or [0xfd509210]
* clear bit 27 of [0xfd504204]
* sleep for 100-200 microseconds
* set bits 7, 10, 12, 13 and clear bits 20, 21 of [0xfd504008]
