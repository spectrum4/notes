# PCIe

Linux starting point: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/602fb860945fd6dce7989fcd3727d5fe4282f785/drivers/pci/controller/pcie-brcmstb.c#L865



pcie regs = Address 0xfd500000 (size 0x9310)

matches: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/b23024676a2f135dbde2221481e2f4af616d0445/arch/arm/boot/dts/bcm2711.dtsi#L555-L587

in low peripheral mode, main peripherals are at 0x00000000fc000000
suggesting low peripherals + 0x01500000

=> 0x47c000000 + 0x01500000 = 0x47d500000 (for full 35-bit address map)


Steps from enumeration example above:
```
* set bits 0 and 1 of 32 bit register [0xfd509210] (reset controller)
* sleep for 1 millisecond
* clear bit 1 of 32 bit register [0xfd509210]
* read back value
* read 32 bit register [0xfd50406c] (REVISION)
* write 0xffffffff to 32 bit register [0xfd504314] (clear interrupts)
* write 0xffffffff to 32 bit register [0xfd504310] (mask interrupts)
* clear bit 0 of 32 bit register [0xfd509210] (bring controller out of reset)
* read 32 bit status register [0xfd504068] every 1ms, up to 100ms, until bits 4 and 5 are set
* report link not ready failure, if bits 4 and 5 are not set, and log value of register
* report PCIe not in RC mode, if bit 7 is not set, and log value of register
* log PCIe link is ready
* read [0xfd50043c] and change bits 0-23 to 0x060400 (pcie-pcie bridge) if not already set
* write [0xfd50400c]=0xf8000000 (lower 32 bits - PCI PCIE address)
* write [0xfd504010]=0x0 (upper 32 bits - PCI PCIE address)
* write [0xfd504070]=0x03f00000
* write [0xfd504080]=0x6
* write [0xfd504084]=0x6
```

> The `dma-ranges` property is used to describe the direct memory access (DMA)
> structure of a memory-mapped bus whose devicetree parent can be accessed from
> DMA operations originating from the bus. It provides a means of defining a

> physical address space of the parent of the bus.
>
> The format of the value of the `dma-ranges` property is an arbitrary number
> of triplets of (`child-bus-address`, `parent-bus-address`, `length`). Each
> triplet specified describes a contiguous DMA address range.
>
> * The `child-bus-address` is a physical address within the child bus' address
>   space. The number of cells to represent the address depends on the bus and
>   can be determined from the `#address-cells` of this node (the node in which
>   the `dma-ranges` property appears).
> * The `parent-bus-address` is a physical address within the parent bus'
>   address space. The number of cells to represent the parent address is bus
>   dependent and can be determined from the `#address-cells` property of the

    scb {
        #address-cells = <2>;

        pcie0: pcie@7d500000 {
            #address-cells = <3>;
            #size-cells = <2>;
            ranges = <0x02000000 0x0 0xc0000000 0x6 0x00000000 0x0 0x40000000>;
            /*

            dma-ranges = <0x02000000 0x0 0x00000000 0x0 0x00000000 0x0 0xc0000000>;
        }
    }
```

From this we see that one range (CPU address -> PCI address):

* child bus address: 0x02000000 0x0 0xc0000000
* parent bus address: 0x6 0x00000000
* length: 0x0 0x40000000

and one DMA range (PCI address -> CPU address) is defined:

* child bus address: 0x02000000 0x0 0x00000000
* parent bus address: 0x0 0x00000000
* length: 0x0 0xc0000000

To understand this better, see:

* [PCI Address Translation](https://elinux.org/Device_Tree_Usage#PCI_Address_Translation)
* [PCI Bus Binding to Open Firmware](https://www.openfirmware.info/data/docs/bus.pci.pdf)

## ranges

One 1GB 32 bit non-prefetchable memory space region mapping is defined:
* CPU physical addresses [0x0000 0006 0000 0000 -> 0x0000 0006 3fff ffff]
maps to:
* PCI addresses [0x0000 0000 c000 0000 -> 0x0000 0000 ffff ffff]

## dma ranges

One 3GB 32 bit non-prefetchable memory space region mapping is defined:
* PCI addresses [0x0000 0000 0000 0000 -> 0x0000 0000 bfff ffff]
maps to:
* CPU physical addresses [0x0000 0000 0000 0000 -> 0x0000 0000 bfff ffff]

Reverse engineering from dmesg logs, where [0xfd504034] (PCIE_MISC_RC_BAR2_CONFIG_LO) = 0x11
and [0xfd504038] (PCIE_MISC_RC_BAR2_CONFIG_HI) = 0x4 and looking at code
[here](https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/blob/14b35093ca68bf2c81bbc90aace5007142b40b40/drivers/pci/controller/pcie-brcmstb.c#L915-L925)
we can deduce what rci bar2 offset and size must be:

```
rc2 bar2 offset:   0bhhhh hhhh hhhh hhhh hhhh hhhh hhhh hhhh llll llll llll llll llll llll llll llll
rc2 bar2 size:     0bHHHH HHHH HHHH HHHH HHHH HHHH HHHH HHHH LLLL LLLL LLLL LLLL LLLL LLLL LLLL LLLL
tmp:               0b0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 llll llll llll llll llll llll llll llll
tmp:               0b0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 llll llll llll llll llll llll lllx xxxx

LO: 0b0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0001 0001 = 0bllll llll llll llll llll llll lllx xxxx

HI: 0b0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0100 = 0bhhhh hhhh hhhh hhhh hhhh hhhh hhhh hhhh

=> rc bar2 offset = 0x4 0000 0000
and brcm_pcie_encode_ibar_size(size) = 0x11
=> log2_in = 32
=> rc bar2 size = 4GB = 0x1 0000 0000
```

## Building Linux kernel under docker (e.g. on macOS)

## Logging mmio read/writes in dmesg logs

```
git reset --hard HEAD; git clean -fdx
git grep -l '\(read\|write\)l' | grep '\.c$' | while read file; do if ! grep -q 'pete_\(read\|write\)l' "${file}"; then echo "processing ${file}..."; git checkout "${file}"; cat "${file}" | sed 's/readl(/pete_&/g' | sed 's/writel(/pete_&/g' | sed 's/_pete_readl/_readl/g' | sed 's/_pete_writel/_writel/g' > y; cat y | grep -n 'pete_\(read\|write\)l' | sed 's/:.*//' | while read line; do cat y | sed "${line}s%pete_readl(%&\"${file}:${line}\", %g" | sed "${line}s%pete_writel(%&\"${file}:${line}\", %g" > x; mv x y; done; mv y "${file}"; fi; done
```

## Building Linux kernel directly on rpi

```
sudo apt install git bc bison flex libssl-dev make
export KERNEL=kernel8 # examples online didn't export, but I have no idea how it reaches make subprocess if not exported
make bcm2711_defconfig
sed -i 's/^\(CONFIG_LOCALVERSION=.*\)"/\1-pmoore"/' .config
sed -i 's/-pmoore-pmoore/-pmoore/' .config
sed -i 's/^# CONFIG_WERROR is not set/CONFIG_WERROR=y/' .config
# sed -i 's/^\(CONFIG_LOG_BUF_SHIFT=\).*/\118/' .config  # (note, this sets the _default_ kernel ring buffer size when an explicit value is not specified in /boot/cmdline.txt - so probably better to just specify in /boot/cmdline.txt instead, and leave the default settings alone)
make -j8 Image.gz

# note - if you get errors about 128 bit integer types, it probably means you are in a 32 bit userspace (file /bin/bash should give you an idea)
# make sure you installed a 64 bit version of Raspbian OS etc, not the standard 32 bit version

sudo cp arch/arm64/boot/Image.gz /boot/kernel8.img

make drivers/pci/controller/pcie-brcmstb.i

edit /boot/cmdline.txt: add `log_buf_len=64M` (`log-buf-len=64M` should also work)

# then boot into kernel, and run
dmesg > dmesg.log 2>&1
scp dmesg.log pmoore@Petes-iMac.local:.  # (for example)
```
