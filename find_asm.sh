# It looks like this was an attempt to write a script to find all the unique
# aarch64 asm instructions used by Spectrum +4 project, probably so I could
# focus on those instructions first when writing my own assembler for the
# project (probably on the SAM Coup√©). Never got any further with this.

# quick and dirty, only wrote/ran this once, not to be maintained
